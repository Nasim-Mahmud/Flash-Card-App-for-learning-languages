# Flash-Card-App-for-learning-languages
A flash card app made in python that will help to learn a new language.

The card will display a word that will automatically convert to English in 3 seconds. When you click the **Check** button, you'll be taken to the next word to guess. If you click the **Cross** button, the word will be saved into another.csv file, and the application will only ask you to guess words you have already failed to guess the next time you use it. There will be no repeating of known words.

This app now contains 100 French words that you can learn. However, by changing the directory and the.csv files, you can modify this application to learn any language.
